# Draw_Gesture
 Choose folder and draw gesture!

### Description
Could not find such simple program, so I wrote by myself simple and basic enough for my needs. 
I decided to share on github, maybe someone else finds this useful. Inspired by http://reference.sketchdaily.net/, https://line-of-action.com/, https://quickposes.com/, and similar websites I don't know.
